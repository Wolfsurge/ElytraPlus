# ElytraPlus
Adds various features to improve elytras.

### Hover Enchantment
Comes in three levels. Each level decreases the cooldown time by 2.5 seconds (50 ticks).
Press the hover key ('V' by default) when wearing an elytra with the enchantment to hover in place.

### Wind Rider Enchantment
Comes in three levels.
Each level increases the speed at which you fly with an elytra.
I: 110% Speed
II: 130% Speed
III: 150% Speed

All the enchantments are found in End City chests, and cannot be obtained elsewhere (e.g. villager trading).

### Trails
You can add trails to your elytra. Put one of the following items in the `Trail` trinket slot (hover over the chest area):
<ul>
<li>Redstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Dust</li>
<li>Slime Ball</li>
<li>Torch</li>
<li>Soul Torch</li>
<li>Dragon Breath</li>
