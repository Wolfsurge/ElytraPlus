# ElytraPlus
Adds various features to improve elytras.

### Hover Enchantment
<i>Lets you flap your Elytra's wings to glide incredibly slowly</i>

Comes in three levels. Each level decreases the cooldown time by 2.5 seconds (50 ticks).
Press the hover key ('V' by default) when wearing an elytra with the enchantment to hover in place.

(10% chance for each level to spawn in an end city chest)

### Wind Rider Enchantment
<i>Improves the aerodynamics of your Elytra's wings to help you travel faster</i>

Comes in three levels.
Each level increases the speed at which you fly with an elytra.
I: 110% Speed
II: 130% Speed
III: 150% Speed

(10% chance for each level to spawn in an end city chest)

### Thermal Ascension
<i>Use hot air to ascend into the sky</i>
<br />
<i>(Does not work in cold environments)</i>

Comes in one level. Press the ascension key ('B' by default) to soar into the air.

All the enchantments are found in End City chests, and cannot be obtained elsewhere (e.g. villager trading).
The chests can have up to two books.

(2% chance for each level to spawn in an end city chest, as it is the most useful)

<ul>
<li>Redstone Dust</li>
<li>Glowstone Dust</li>
